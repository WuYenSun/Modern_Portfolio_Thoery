Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) has been a fundamental concept in investment management for decades. 
Developed by economist Harry Markowitz in the 1950s, MPT revolutionized the way investors approached portfolio construction and risk management.

MPT assumes that all market participants are identical and focus solely on the first two moments of asset returns. 
This theory offers two key insights. Firstly, rational market participants select portfolios exclusively on the efficient frontier, which represents the optimal risk-return trade-off. 
Secondly, the inclusion of a risk-free asset can improve the Sharpe ratio of the set of feasible portfolios. Interestingly, all rational investors hold the same market portfolio, which is the point of tangency between the efficient frontier and the capital allocation line.

MPT assumes that all investors have access to the same information, possess rational decision-making abilities, and have homogeneous investment preferences. However, in reality, market participants differ in their knowledge, behavior, and risk tolerance. 
MPT also assumes that asset returns follow a normal distribution, disregarding the presence of extreme events or market anomalies. Additionally, MPT's reliance on historical data for estimating risk and return may not capture future market dynamics accurately. These limitations highlight the need for complementary approaches and a more holistic understanding of the complexities inherent in investment management.
